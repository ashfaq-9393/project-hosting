        <h2>About Psychpal</h2><br>
        <p>This project leverages Federated Learning (FL) to develop a personalized mental health therapy chatbot while ensuring user privacy, personalization, and quick response times. Unlike traditional AI models that store user data on central servers, this chatbot learns from interactions directly on users' devices, sharing only encrypted model updates to improve global learning.
